# Brad Traversy Loruki Website

This is a copy of an example website clone made by Brad Traversy. I'm making this while following along with his video. He is combining various HTML and CSS covered in his videos.

My plan is to at some point clean up these files. They are okay but seem a little haphazzard to me.

## Thoughts

- Pros
  - The video is fairly in-depth.
  - I think this is a good demonstration of the topics covered in his other videos.

- Cons
  - The CSS seems like it could be unmaintainable.
  - There was one time where he forgot where something was defined in his CSS.
