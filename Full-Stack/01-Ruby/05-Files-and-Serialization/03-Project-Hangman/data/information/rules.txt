The goal of Hangman is to guess the secret word.

In this version, the computer picks a random word between 5 and 12 characters.

The player then enters a letter. If the letter is in the secret word, all
occurences are revealed. 

If the guess is incorrect, the letter is added to the 'misses' list. 

The player gets up to 5 misses, at which point the game ends.
