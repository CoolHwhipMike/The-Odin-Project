## What type of algorithm would you use to perform a binary search?
A divide and conquer algorithm. The list is cut in half each time, thus making you search area smaller.

## What abstract data type would you use to defer/store nodes in a breadth-first tree traversal?
A queue

## What abstract data type would you use to defer/store nodes in a depth-first tree traversal?
A stack
