## Why is there a question mark after some methods?
It indicates a predicate method what checks for a condition and returns true or false. For example, .even? is almost like asking the yes or no question of "is this thing even?".

## What does the #include? method do?
It checks if something exists in the array or hash. So, is *this thing* included, within, an array.

## What does the #any? method do?
Returns true if any of the elemets match your condition.

## What does the #all? method do?
Returns true if all the elements match your condition.

## What does the #none? method do?
Returns true if none of the elements match your condition.
