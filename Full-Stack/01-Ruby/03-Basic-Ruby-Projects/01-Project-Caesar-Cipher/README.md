# The Odin Project: Caesar Cipher

A Caesar Cipher takes a phrase and shifts the letters by a number called a Caesar shift. For example, the string *abc* with a shift of *2* would become *cde*.

# Pseudocode
[&check;] Have the user input a string.
[&check;] Have the user input a number for the shift.
[ ] Split the string into an array.
[ ] Convert that string to the ASCII code.
[ ] Add the shift to the ASCII numbers while skipping spaces and punctuation.
[ ] Don't forget to wrap from z to a and keep the same case.
[ ] Convert the ASCII back to a character.
[ ] Join the array to a string.
[ ] Return the shifted string.
