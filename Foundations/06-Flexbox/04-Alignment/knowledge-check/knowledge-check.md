Justify-content work on the main axis and align-items works on the cross axis.

## How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?
Set justify-content: center and align-items: center.

## Whatâ€™s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?
Space-between maximizes space between the items and space-around sets the same space around each item. This causes "more" the space between items than around them. Space-evenly adjusts the space between items to make them look evenly spaced.
