## What should your question always include?
Provide the relevent code and context for your problem. This will help to focus on the actual problem that you are experiencing. It will also allow people to see and test what you are having an issue with.

You should also ask about the problem and not for a solution. This helps you to figure out you problem rather than just getting an answer.

Explain what you have already tried. This save time by not venturing down dead ends.

## Describe the "XY Problem".
When you have a problem X and think you can solve it by doing Y. But, you need help with Y too. You waste time asking about Y because you get solutions that aren't relevent to the actual problem. Avoid this by providing context and sharing what you've already tried.

## Describe a "help vampire".
A person that asks the same questions as other users, doesn't do any work themselves (Google), asks vague questions, is short-tempered, and basically just wants an answer provided for free.
