# README for The-Odin-Project

These are projects and exercises that I have been doing to learn/practice web development by following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), hence the repo name. Some of the exercises are from Wes Bos's [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com) series.

There are 3 paths in The Odin Project:
- Foundations
- Full Stack Ruby On Rails
- Full Stack Javascript

Many lessons have questions at the end. Previously I read/answered offline, but my answers are now saved in the **knowledge-check** directory in each path.

Some of the lessons also have additional practice exercises. These have now been moved into the **practice** directory in each path.

The learning here is based largely on completing projects. For now, these are in the **projects** directory in each path. As I learn more I may revisit the projects and split them into individual repos are they grow into something more complete.
