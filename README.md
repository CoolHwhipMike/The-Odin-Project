# README for The-Odin-Project

## Background

These are projects and exercises that I have been doing to learn/practice web development by following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), hence the repo name. Some of the exercises are from Wes Bos's [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com) series.

There are 3 paths in The Odin Project:
- Foundations
- Full Stack Ruby On Rails
- Full Stack Javascript

## Repository Structure

I condensed the 3 paths into 2 for my repo. They are Foundations and Full-Stack. This is due to the fact that the Ruby path has everything from the Javascript path except Node. So, I'm following the Ruby path and just adding the missing Node section.

## Updated Notes

Many lessons have questions at the end. Previously I read/answered offline, but my answers are now saved in the **knowledge-check** directory in each path.

Some of the lessons also have additional practice exercises. These have now been moved into the **practice** directory in each path.

The learning here is based largely on completing projects. For now, these are in the **projects** directory in each path. As I learn more I may revisit the projects and split them into individual repos are they grow into something more complete.
