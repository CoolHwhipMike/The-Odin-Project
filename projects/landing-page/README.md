## The Odin Project - Landing Page

This is the landing page project for the Odin Project. Reference files are in src.

There are two slightly different versions. The first, that has a *.old* suffix, I tried to keep organized but towards the end got a little sloppy.

The second, with no additional suffix, version I tried to follow the CUBE CSS style. I think I mostly did. I'm not sure how much of a difference it made but it's something to investigate more. It seems easier than BEM.
