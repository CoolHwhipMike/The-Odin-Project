# The Odin Project - Recipes

I've decided to complete the Odin Project. The first project is to build a basic recipe website. The tutorials start with HTML only, so even though I know some CSS, the first commit here will only be what's covered in the first project.

## Goals for the first part of this project

1. [&check;] Create an *index.html*.
2. [&check;] Fill out the boilerplate and add *Odin Recipies* as an *h1*.
3. [&check;] Create a new *recipes* directory.
4. [&check;] Create a page in the *recipes* directory named for the recipe.
5. [&check;] Add the recipes name as an *h1*.
6. [&check;] Link to the new page from *index.html*.
7. [&check;] Add image of finished dish to recipe page.
8. [&check;] Add a description and paragraphs describing the dish.
9. [&check;] Under description add a *ul* of needed ingredients.
10. [&check;] Under ingredients add an *ol* of the steps.
11. [&check;] Add two more recipies.

## Goals for the second part of this project

1. [&check;] Add some styling with external CSS.

## Finishing thoughts

For *Attempt Two* I changed a few things and didn't follow the directions exactly. I changed the directory structure slightly and don't have my recipes organized as a list. I liked the idea of a card type layout and nesting that inside a list didn't make sense to me.

This site could use more design work. It should be resposive but could be better. I also need to work on simplifying the CSS.
